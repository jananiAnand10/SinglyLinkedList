# SinglyLinkedList
This repository offers a comprehensive implementation of a Singly Linked List in Java, providing a variety of operations and utility methods to manipulate the list efficiently. A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence, allowing for sequential traversal.

Key Features:
Basic Operations:
Insertion: Add nodes at the beginning, end, or at a specified position in the list.
Deletion: Remove nodes from the beginning, end, or a specific position within the list.
Traversal: Iterate through the list to access or display elements.

Advanced Methods:
Reverse Between: Reverse the nodes between two given positions in the list, allowing for partial list reversal.
Binary to Integer Conversion: Convert a binary number represented by the linked list (where each node holds a binary digit) into its corresponding integer value.
Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate nodes from the list, ensuring each element is unique.

How to Use:
Clone this repository and include the SinglyLinkedList class in your Java project.
Instantiate the class and utilize the provided methods to perform various operations on the list.
